### **Get Stuff Done**

>### Incoming Updates 
>We are aiming to release a new version of GSD: GSD Flow, this will be a premium version available only through a one-time payment. GSD Flow will include premium features including a more powerful note taking, other features like, possibly, post-it notes directly to you windows. And more organisation tools. GSD Notes will be renamed GSD Task. And, upon the coming of GSD Flow, the standard GSD version will lose support. The versioning of GSD will remain simultaneous. Every new GSD Task update will bring a new GSD Flow update. We predict that these changes will arrive with v3.0 of GSD Notes.
